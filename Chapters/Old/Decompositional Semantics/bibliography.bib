	abstract = {Six experiments, with 108 undergraduates, tested the hypothesis that adults have direct, nonderived access to overall similarity in the classification of separable stimuli (size and brightness). In 2 experiments, high-speed classification by a similarity rule was either as equally accurate as or more accurate than classification by a dimensional rule, and similarity classification was consistently less affected by accelerating performance. Results suggest that adults' access to overall similarity relations of separable stimuli is not based on recombination of dimensional information. Four experiments tested the hypothesis that adults spontaneously use similarity relations when normal classification is disrupted. Spontaneous classifications under conditions of speed, with a concurrent task load, and with an instruction for impressionistic reponding, elicited overall similarity classifications. In a 2nd classification task, however, speed did not increase overall similarity responding. Results suggest an asymmetry of the integralityâ€“separability distinction. Separable dimensions apparently offer 2 easily available classification modes, but integral dimensions offer only one.},

	url = {https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/20303},
	abstract = {Generally, it has been argued that most natural categories are organized in terms of a family resemblance {(FR)} principle. However, Medin, Wattenmaker, and Hampson (1987) have shown that people do not create categories according to the {FR} principle in free sorting tasks, given exemplars consisting of independent dimensions. A two-stage model of category construction is presented to specify the conditions under which {FR} categories would be produced. The first stage involved uni-dimensional sorting of most of the given exemplars into the prescribed number of groups. The second stage involves assigning the remaining exemplars into the initially created categories. The two-stage model explains {FR} sorting as a by-product of the two stages and predicts that {FR} sorting can be obtained only when there are sufficient features for possible {FR} categories. Experiment 1 compared the two-stage model with previous models of category construction, including a similarity-based model, a category-validity model and {CLUSTER/2.} The two-stage model was shown as the best predictor for when different types of sorting would be obtained. Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to test the generality of the two-stage model across different types of stimuli and different types of task demands. Experiment 4 investigated alternative explanations for apparently conflicting results from L. B. Smith (1981). Throughout all the experiments, the two-stage model is shown as the best predictor of subjects' sorting behavior. Implications of the results for the development of {FR} categories are discussed.},

	abstract = {The current consensus is that most natural categories are not organized around strict definitions (a list of singly necessary and jointly sufficient features) but rather according to a family resemblance {(FR)} principle: Objects belong to the same category because they are similar to each other and dissimilar to objects in contrast categories. A number of computational models of category construction have been developed to provide an account of how and why people create {FR} categories {[Anderson}, 1990]; {[Fisher}, 1987]. Surprisingly, however, only a few experiments on category construction or free sorting have been run and they suggest that people do not sort examples by the {FR} principle. We report several new experiments and a two-stage model for category construction. This model is contrasted with a variety of other models with respect to their ability to account for when {FR} sorting will and will not occur. The experiments serve to identify one basis for {FR} sorting and to support the two-stage model. The distinctive property of the two-stage model is that it assumes that people impose more structure than the examples support in the first stage and that the second stage adjusts for this difference between preferred and perceived structure. We speculate that people do not simply assimilate probabilistic structures but rather organize them in terms of discrete structures plus noise.},

We distinguish between two classes of systematic polysemy: constructional polysemy, where a single sense assigned to a lexical entry is contextually specialized, and sense extension, which predictably relates two or more senses. Formally the first case is treated as instantiation of an underspecified lexical entry and the second by use of lexical rules. The problems of distinguishing between these two classes are discussed in detail. We illustrate how lexical rules can be used both to relate fully conventionalized senses and also applied productively to recognize novel usages and how this process can be controlled to account for semi-productivity by utilizing probabilities.},

a new type calculus that captures one of the fundamental ideas of
{GL:} providing a set of techniques governing type shifting possibilities

items in cases where there is an apparent type mismatch. These techniques
themselves should follow from the structure of the lexicon and

	title = {Are there representational shifts during category learning?},
	volume = {45},
	abstract = {Early theories of categorization assumed that either rules, or prototypes, or exemplars
were exclusively used to mentally represent categories of objects. More recently,
hybrid theories of categorization have been proposed that variously combine these
different forms of category representation. Our research addressed the question of
whether there are representational shifts during category learning. We report a series
of experiments that tracked how individual subjects generalized their acquired category
knowledge to classifying new critical transfer items as a function of learning. Individual
differences were observed in the generalization patterns exhibited by subjects,
and those generalizations changed systematically with experience. Early in learning,
subjects generalized on the basis of single diagnostic dimensions, consistent with the
use of simple categorization rules. Later in learning, subjects generalized in a manner
consistent with the use of similarity-based exemplar retrieval, attending to multiple
stimulus dimensions. Theoretical modeling was used to formally corroborate these
empirical observations by comparing fits of rule, prototype, and exemplar models
to the observed categorization data. Although we provide strong evidence for shifts
in the kind of information used to classify objects as a function of categorization experience,
interpreting these results in terms of shifts in representational systems underlying
perceptual categorization is a far thornier issue. We provide a discussion of the challenges of making claims about category representation, making reference to a
wide body of literature suggesting different kinds of representational systems in perceptual
categorization and related domains of human cognition.},

a view known as psychological essentialism. I distinguish three varieties of
psychological essentialism and investigate the ways in which essentialism
explains the inferences for which it is supposed to account. Essentialism
succeeds in explaining the inferences, I argue, because it attributes to the
child belief in causal laws connecting category membership and the possession
of certain characteristic appearances and behavior. This suggests that
the data will be equally well explained by a non-essentialist hypothesis that
attributes belief in the appropriate causal laws to the child, but makes no
claim as to whether or not the child represents essences. I provide several
reasons to think that this non-essentialist hypothesis is in fact superior to
any version of the essentialist hypothesis.},

The present study investigated the hypothesis that this developmental trend is restricted to the classification of simple objects that differ only by limited amounts on a few dimensions. The specific hypothesis was that overall-similarity relations structure both adults' and children's classifications of heterogenous objects (objects that differ in a variety of ways). This hypothesis was suggested by the correspondence between the structure of young children's classifications and the structure of natural categories. The result of two experiments supported the hypothesis. When the to-be-classified objects varied simultaneously on relatively many dimensions, adults as well as children constructed classifications that maximized within-category similarity on all varying dimensions. The implications of these results for accounts of the perception of multidimensional relations and classificatory behavior are discussed.},

@article{smith_incomplete_2012,
	title = {Incomplete Understanding of Concepts: The Case of the Derivative},
	abstract = {Many philosophers have discussed the ability of thinkers to think
thoughts that the thinker cannot justify because the thoughts involve
concepts that the thinker incompletely understands. A standard ex-
ample of this phenomenon, the one around which this paper revolves,
involves the concept of the derivative in the early days of the calculus:
Newton and Leibniz incompletely understood the derivative concept
and, hence, as Berkeley noted, they could not justify their thoughts in-
volving it. Later, so the story goes, Weierstrass justied their thoughts
by giving a correct explication of the derivative concept. This paper
discusses various accounts of how one should think about how a thinker
manages to think with a concept that they incompletely understands
{\textbar} including Christopher Peacocke's {\textbackslash}implicit conceptions" approach
and Georges Rey's {\textbackslash}deference to optimal theory" approach {\textbar} and
nds them wanting in the case at hand. Part of the overlooked com-
plexity is that there are many derivative concepts and it is unclear in
virtue of what a thinker would be thinking with one of them rather
than another. After critical evaluation of standard accounts, this paper
suggests a novel account of how one should think about the derivative
concepts with which Newton and Leibniz thought and how Weierstrass
could have managed to justify their thoughts even if their thoughts did
not involve the same derivative concept as Weierstrass'.},

from memory, with rates determined by their similarity to test items. The retrieved exemplars provide
incremental information that enters into a random walk process for making classification decisions.
The model predicts correctly effects of within- and between-categories similarity, individual-object familiarity, and extended practice on classification response times. It also builds bridges between the domains of categorization and automaticity.},
